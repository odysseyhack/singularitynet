## Challenge
Building an ecosystem towards abundance to solve hunger problems using the fonio grain.

## Step 0: What is our passion?
We want to use decentralized artificial intelligence for the benefit of our world, to tackle world problems, and to build ecosystem that are meaningful, impactful, and world-changing.

We want to be open-minded and inspired, and as such we killed the idea after a couple of iterations and we pivoted from the idea we initially had, and we were motivated to solve a bigger problem than we could have ever thought we could even imagine to tackle: World Hunger.

We believe that by creating an AI-powered decentralized production ecosystem for farmers, we could help them produce many foods in abundance, such as with the fonio grain which is our main example.

## Step 1: Starting with a basic need or a big ownerless problem that needs to be solved.
The current reality is that food production and food value chains are exploiting scarcity to create value. World Hunger is a huge problem that immediately taps into our basic needs of nutrition.

To tackle this system we need to rethink the way we go about food production and stakeholders involved in this ecosystem. We need to aim for a couple of goals:
1. Producing food in abundance.
2. Producing food without profit in mind.
3. Create autonomous AI systems that can power modular machines so machines can be used for various types of food production.
4. Empower people to contribute out of intrinsic motivation.
5. Use lessons from nature to guide us to success.


Chad Situation

1. The food security and nutrition situation is deteriorating.
2. The chronicity of the crisis requires a new way of working combining humanitarian and development interventions.
3. It is reported that in 2018, $282.5 million would be needed to save the lives of those most affected by the food and nutrition crisis in Chad.

Income, malnutrition

Note: desertification.

## Step 2: Rethink the current value chains into a commons
We had the opportunity to learn from Jurrien about his experiences with quinoa, and how the business model around quinoa has created issues for local people as they cannot afford to eat their own grains anymore.

The business model value chain is usually something like the following:
<description/graph>



The lock-ins we are looking at are:

In order to conquer these hurdles we need to take several steps to ensure a commons instead of a business. For example:

## Step 3: How can the ecosystem evolve towards abundance?
An essential part of ensuring the ecosystem to evolve towards abundance is to focus on the modularity of hardware systems so it can be reused for various food production purposes, and a distributed microservices architecture of AI algorithms to power these hardware systems in a highly efficient and versatile way. AI developers from our community all over the world can help contribute AI services to empower hardware systems of farmers to function for optimal production to grow towards abundance.

We have to note that some food productions are easier to move towards than others. E.g. fonio has a harvesting cycle of every 6-8 weeks and can grow on the hardest places on earth. The difficulty with harvesting fonio on mass scale is in the processing part of the grain, which is usually done manually. However, we can automate this process and ensure a Nx faster production on the same timescale on the short term.

Furthermore, for the hardware systems we have some useful ways to hack around this. In many countries in Africa new hardware systems are hard to get and are very expensive (although populations are often relatively well equipped with smartphones) however, in all first and second world countries hardware parts are abundant as we tend to just throw things away. It is possible to recycle these parts into the parts we need to build hardware systems for the farmers. For example, even with a jerry can and some computer parts you could be building a new computer that works perfectly well and can use the exact same software like a new computer in the western world could do. It is therefore essential to find partners that can help us gather these parts for free through donations and recycling.

Furthermore, there are many parties readily aligned with our mission and incentivised to contribute, such as a number of teams we met at the Odyssey Hackathon (e.g. Oddyss, Berchain, Giveth, Habari, and many more), the Government of Chad, the European Union with their Blockchain for Social Good, the Decentralized AI Alliance with 40+ partners, and our community of 100.000 singularitarians and AI enthusiasts that can help us build out this mission without any goal of making money, but to actually build systems that work for a beneficial world.

Finally, the system we are developing is trying to enable basic human rights to the people in Chad, instead of going through an expensive court system that rewards lawyers financially for getting the rights one already has, we want to enable the access to that which enables the human right to be exercised: a system for all.

## Step 4: Rethink to maximize intrinsic motivation: Who cares without wanting to be the owner? Maximize!
There are many official and unofficial parties that care currently without claiming ownership of the problem but are contributing to solving the problem such as:
1. United Nations
2. Save the Children
3. World Food Programme
4. World Bank



## Step 5: Digital: Design as a global distributed service.
We are designing the digital twin as a worldwide service accessible via a decentralized microservice architecture with an unlimited amount of AI services available within the SingularityNET World Hunger Federation.

Hardware can be either built from recycled parts that are found in excessive amounts in the things we throw away into a specific design pattern which will be provided.

This will allow anyone to connect to a global distributed service.

NO ECONOMIC MODEL ALWAYS CHALLENGE THIS IN OUR PLANS

## Step 6: Design the digital world to connect humans. Design as a social and warm hub.
Within our system one can create an identity and join into a community with a specific impact goal, such as fighting the hunger world problem in Chad in our fonio project. By using Momentum Voting from the Giveth Team we can have people suggest the next impact goals to work on to tackle this problem and collaborate together on, and then vote on what they want to work on next depending on what is most needed in the moment. This allows for a more fluid governance process where collaboration is motivated and where there is enough flexibility to change course if needed to reach the final destination of the solution.

A community is structured as follows:
1. One has a community that one can join or leave at will.
2. The community defines a main goal, such as producing fonio in abundance to solve world hunger problems.
3. The community creates smaller impact goals within this community to contribute to the main goal, and this is something that they can vote on with momentum voting from Giveth.
4. Members of the community can contribute to these goals by committing code towards the goal and deploying the AI services or other software on the SingularityNET platform for access by the fonio farmers.
5. Once a goal is successfully achieved, members get a unique badge from the Bernchain team for contributing to this, which is a non-transferable badge of honor unique to the person's achievements and computed and awarded by AI.
6. By using SingularityNET People Analytics AI we can ensure a good atmosphere guided by intrinsic motivation and also help realign members whenever needed.

## Step 7: Rethink your financing! Aim for a wholeheartedly supported commons, an ecosystem towards abundance.
In our idea, crowdsourcing will be our main means of creating the solutions needed. E.g.:
1. Recycling partners that can donate their hardware trash to us to rebuild modular hardware systems for fonio farmers.
2. AI developers within the SingularityNET community that can contribute an AI service to help hardware systems perform food processing tasks better.
3. Teams at the hackathon, the United Nations, European Union, World Food Programme, World Bank, the Government of Chad, and many more organizations that can contribute their expert knowledge and enable the acceleration of the building of critical infrastructures needed.

# OpenCog
Using OpenCog to create stories that make the people of Chad proud of their fonio grain and to inspire the others in the world.



# Below will be rephrased and repurposed to the new idea.

## Narrative
First three phases
first it has not totally disappeared, grains grows there since 5000 years
all cultures and tribes that live in the subsajharan hundreds of tribes, had fonio in their staple daily food. Several tribes have a religious name for fonio, because it was so important in their daily food for the right types of proteine and they knew how to grow it. 

The Godon called it po. Po meant origin of the universe. fonio was almost religious. subsaharan areas senegal to sudan, fonio was known as a seed which is a grass seed. it grows around the rain season, fastest growing seed that we know, 6.5 to 8 weeks growing. Then harvested and then comes the tricky part, you have the fotos of women long tubes of phonio and seed is so incrediblky small that none of the regular types of machinery could do this, but here in the western part nobody can build a machine that can peel fonio. but in subsaharan africa (pictures available)developed a machine, one of them has been here in holland and he present it to the best machine  builder and he said no i cant build something like that. this is important because it limits themachine to small communities, because the machine needs to be produced (right now 3000-3500 euro per machine). This machine needs to be in the place where we want to start the production and reintroduction of fonio in chad. there is a farm where a lot of pictures and films and this farm is called ledouabvere (the green fingers) a family farm, mother with kids and personel, they tried almost every seed in the world to grow in the desert soil. They bring organic matter in the ground, and if you have water and knowledge and people know what they are doing, then you can grow almost anything. under the subsahara is one of the largest sweet water reservoirs in the world. many people dont know that. from senegal to sudan enormous amounts of water, sometimes half a meter sometimes 90 meters deep in the ground. ledouvere has the water and bought some land last year that they want to take into production this year, around rain season (april/may) they want to grow fonio as an agricultural activity. They want to do this because they want to make a set of lessons for at first small holder farmers in chad, that support and agree with reintroducing fonio in staple food menu because it is local and almost for nothing. One of the few seeds where we must be able to create abundance. the requirements are so low. the seed is good to eat and phd from 2015 is fonio important contribution to staple food in region: yes it is. (report can be shared). PHD says (wageningen) subsahara iron deficiency and zink deficiency in chat 12% had food scarcity problems, this summer will be 20%, it is around 15-20% dont know if they will have a meal. the nutrition problem is immense. Reason for women to be vulnerable is higher. fonio in the fight against this main deficiency of iron deficiency.

Health problem component, world hunger component, report available of proteine characteristics and nutrients.

ledouabvere the farm will start growing, describing, explaining what they want to educate and teach colleagues how they can grow it as an agricultural activity in as many places as possible in chad. Comming from a commons based erspective to help you helpo yourself, the elephant in the room. They were extremely enthuisiastic when in ledouvere and met a phd 85 years, doctor derek rijks, connected to 6 big refugee camps in sudanese border in chad. every border immense refugee camps. chad poorest country in the region, people are in the camps and they are totally dependent on aid from world food program, this guy mister rijks heard about the story from ledouaver, if i teach 3-5 women in this camps how to grow fonio all camps will grow fonio. they learned how to build solar cookers and they developed in a carton box which was open with aluminium inside with a pan 100000 cookers, ladies developed factory where they produce these things and a blanket where you can put the meal in the poan so it can stay warm. So they develop things where they avoid using wood, because when they came to sudan.

Using the solar cookers makes them independent for cooking meals. Mister rijks said suddenly when i was in chad all of a sudden lebouvere was (PHASE 2) first group of people will not be chadian small holders but teaching the women from these 6 refugee camps and, temporary cities as refugee camp (some are 20 years old, nobody has learned how to grow food, knowledge is gone). totally dependent, small nudging steps the impact will be immense. djaminah capital chad upscale to the 6 camps.

Ready to supply small machines then, it cannot be peeled in original way, otherwise it is inhuman you cant do that.

third phase same week, meeting planned with minister of agriculture of Chad, she totally understands what jurrien was talking aboutm because she said when she was a child she was eating it and nowadays as well, it tastes a bit like quinoa, nutty seed, very nice, use it as cous cous, gluten free, the proteine content is a lot higher, it is super super food, characteristics that quinoa doesnt have --> you can create abundance. quinoa grows in the area where no agriculture is possible, whilst fonio grows on the border of the desert ledouaver. If we have more land and we know how to grow under the poorest and richest conditions (djamina ledouaver (rich) and poorest (refugee camps)). if we can prove that in these refugee camp you can grow these fonio, no men allowed, in these regions you can only build up things with women, because conditions are so extreme and they are responsible for children etc. totally women activity, Phase 2 -- yes we can create abundance even in the region around refugee camps.

minister: fonio put on the list urgency list priority in methods to fight food insecurity. second, if you are at a phase of upscaling, i can promise you now that we have a lot of land that is owned by the government it is desert or in process of desertification, 5times 200 hectares of land where you can get the next proof of concept and the next proof that this works, and then we can translate and say okay where is the water. Dutch company with water pumps 100 meters deep guaranteed 30 years. Sensors IOT. Investments are extremely low, phase 3.

Hopefully we can then prove that abundance is on the horizon, we can calculate when it will be there, and we can think about smart ways to distribute the abundance. You can then try to - i fyou know what the value is that you created together, as owners you also want to negotiate how to distribute the value, ebcause you cannot eat more than a certain portion of fonio per day. In this moment the direction to fight food insecurity is with imported seeds and grains, a lot of that food is upside down and they are part of the french republic. That is in a nutshell the background of the story of where we are.

What is important to know is that there is a man in New York who is called Piere Tiam, and he has a brilliant ted talk on fonio. He lighted the story in jurrien, and then he was connected to it. This guy translates the proteine contribution of abundance of fonio to the rest of the world. He upgrades it and listens to in fact on a global scale we have a global nutritional problem, but we deny it. If you look at the food that we use in western world, where 70% of the resources use for 30% of the population, and we are still allow big players whi are too big to fail and too big to feed, so big and responsible for the nutrition of the world.

create an environment where the organization type of a community, from the organic company. participatory guarantee system  people that grow and process support the idea together with these people you form a community so you install a community
how do we registet what value od we use --> token or whatever
iuse that in order to make that value visible and so uyou can think about how can we now to distribute that again and we start with the farmers, around it family, friends family, refugee camps, and how can we offer fonio to them as well,

instead of AI problem of connecting people in a sustainable community + the financial part green churches  connecting with chad, if we could have a shared responsibility, if you could share your richness and intentions with a community on the other side of the world, under the condition that we can look into what they are doing, but the other way around as well so Chad learns from them too and connecting p2p. Share the meal of the world food program. Picture of your meal, 50 dollarcents automatically transferred to the meal. Inspired very indivudal peer to peer. Peer to peer communities.






## Overview
We are building a system that a community (local government, club, commons, etc) can use to define good behaviors, track user behavior, identify people who enact good behaviors to possibly reward them, verify the effects of enacting such behavior for the community. The system aims to be generic enough that you can use it to track different problems: resource consumption, social behavior, political action, education policies, etc.

For the purposes of this hackathon, we are building a system that tracks gas consumption in a population and identifies households that consume less gas than average for their household type with the goal of rewarding such households within the community (with things such as tax credits, or free public transportation, etc).



## Components
- Smart meters that upload the hashed and timestamped gas consumption readings for a household
- Oracle, implemented as a SingularityNET service, to retrieve the gas consumption readings for each household, behavior data for identities in the community and public information about the community itself (example: carbon footprint of the community)
- Database of households (identity -> household type), hashed and timestamped at regular intervals
- A smart contract on a public blockchain with the latest timestamped hash of the households data
- AI service that confronts the readings with its own trained model to determine whether a household is enacting good behavior; the output (household, reward, input data, confidence) should be hashed and timestamped for auditing purposes
- Pluggable reward system that defines the ruleset and distributes incentives for each identity
