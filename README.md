# SingularityNET Odyssey Nature 2.0 entry

## Challenge
Building an ecosystem towards abundance to solve hunger problems using the fonio grain.

## Step 0: What is our passion?
We want to use decentralized artificial intelligence for the benefit of our world, to tackle world problems, and to build ecosystem that are meaningful, impactful, and world-changing.

We want to be open-minded and inspired by the Odyssey Hackathon, and as such we killed the idea we wanted to execute at the end of day 1, and we were motivated to solve a bigger problem than we could have ever thought we could even imagine to tackle: World Hunger.

We believe that by creating an AI-powered decentralized production ecosystem for farmers, we could help them produce many foods in abundance, such as with the fonio grain which is our main example.

## Step 1: Starting with a basic need or a big ownerless problem that needs to be solved.
The current reality is that food production and food value chains are exploiting scarcity to create value. World Hunger is a huge problem that immediately taps into our basic needs of nutrition.

To tackle this system we need to rethink the way we go about food production and stakeholders involved in this ecosystem. We need to aim for a couple of goals:
1. Producing food in abundance.
2. Producing food without profit in mind.
3. Create autonomous AI systems that can power modular machines so machines can be used for various types of food production.
4. Empower people to contribute out of intrinsic motivation.
5. Use lessons from nature to guide us to success.


Chad Situation

1. The food security and nutrition situation is deteriorating.
2. The chronicity of the crisis requires a new way of working combining humanitarian and development interventions.
3. It is reported that in 2018, $282.5 million would be needed to save the lives of those most affected by the food and nutrition crisis in Chad.


Note: desertification.

## Step 2: Rethink the current value chains into a commons
We had the opportunity to learn from Jurrien about his experiences with quinoa, and how the business model around quinoa has created issues for local people as they cannot afford to eat their own grains anymore.

The business model value chain is usually something like the following:

The lock-ins we are looking at are:

In order to conquer these hurdles we need to take several steps to ensure a commons instead of a business. For example:

## Step 3: How can the ecosystem evolve towards abundance?
An essential part of ensuring the ecosystem to evolve towards abundance is to focus on the modularity of hardware systems so it can be reused for various food production purposes, and a distributed microservices architecture of AI algorithms to power these hardware systems in a highly efficient and versatile way. AI developers from our community all over the world can help contribute AI services to empower hardware systems of farmers to function for optimal production to grow towards abundance.

We have to note that some food productions are easier to move towards than others. E.g. fonio has a harvesting cycle of every 6-8 weeks and can grow on the hardest places on earth. The difficulty with harvesting fonio on mass scale is in the processing part of the grain, which is usually done manually. However, we can automate this process and ensure a Nx faster production on the same timescale on the short term.

Furthermore, for the hardware systems we have some useful ways to hack around this. In many countries in Africa new hardware systems are hard to get and are very expensive (although populations are often relatively well equipped with smartphones) however, in all first and second world countries hardware parts are abundant as we tend to just throw things away. It is possible to recycle these parts into the parts we need to build hardware systems for the farmers. For example, even with a jerry can and some computer parts you could be building a new computer that works perfectly well and can use the exact same software like a new computer in the western world could do. It is therefore essential to find partners that can help us gather these parts for free through donations and recycling.

Furthermore, there are many parties readily aligned with our mission and incentivised to contribute, such as a number of teams we met at the Odyssey Hackathon (e.g. Oddyss, Berchain, Giveth, Habari, and many more), the Government of Chad, the European Union with their Blockchain for Social Good, the Decentralized AI Alliance with 40+ partners, and our community of 100.000 singularitarians and AI enthusiasts that can help us build out this mission without any goal of making money, but to actually build systems that work for a beneficial world.

Finally, the system we are developing is trying to enable basic human rights to the people in Chad, instead of going through an expensive court system that rewards lawyers financially for getting the rights one already has, we want to enable the access to that which enables the human right to be exercised: a system for all.

## Step 4: Rethink to maximize intrinsic motivation: Who cares without wanting to be the owner? Maximize!
There are many official and unofficial parties that care currently without claiming ownership of the problem but are contributing to solving the problem such as:
1. United Nations
2. Save the Children
3. World Food Programme
4. World Bank



## Step 5: Digital: Design as a global distributed service.
We are designing the digital twin as a worldwide service accessible via a decentralized microservice architecture with an unlimited amount of AI services available within the SingularityNET World Hunger Federation.

Hardware can be either built from recycled parts that are found in excessive amounts in the things we throw away into a specific design pattern which will be provided.

This will allow anyone to connect to a global distributed service.

## Step 6: Design the digital world to connect humans. Design as a social and warm hub.
Within our system one can create an identity and join into a community with a specific impact goal, such as fighting the hunger world problem in Chad in our fonio project. By using Momentum Voting from the Giveth Team we can have people suggest the next impact goals to work on to tackle this problem and collaborate together on, and then vote on what they want to work on next depending on what is most needed in the moment. This allows for a more fluid governance process where collaboration is motivated and where there is enough flexibility to change course if needed to reach the final destination of the solution.

A community is structured as follows:
1. One has a community that one can join or leave at will.
2. The community defines a main goal, such as producing fonio in abundance to solve world hunger problems.
3. The community creates smaller impact goals within this community to contribute to the main goal, and this is something that they can vote on with momentum voting from Giveth.
4. Members of the community can contribute to these goals by committing code towards the goal and deploying the AI services or other software on the SingularityNET platform for access by the fonio farmers.
5. Once a goal is successfully achieved, members get a unique badge from the Bernchain team for contributing to this, which is a non-transferable badge of honor unique to the person's achievements and computed and awarded by AI.
6. By using SingularityNET People Analytics AI we can ensure a good atmosphere guided by intrinsic motivation and also help realign members whenever needed.

## Step 7: Rethink your financing! Aim for a wholeheartedly supported commons, an ecosystem towards abundance.
In our idea, crowdsourcing will be our main means of creating the solutions needed. E.g.:
1. Recycling partners that can donate their hardware trash to us to rebuild modular hardware systems for fonio farmers.
2. AI developers within the SingularityNET community that can contribute an AI service to help hardware systems perform food processing tasks better.
3. Teams at the hackathon, the United Nations, European Union, World Food Programme, World Bank, the Government of Chad, and many more organizations that can contribute their expert knowledge and enable the acceleration of the building of critical infrastructures needed. 


## Narrative



## Overview
We are building a system that a community (local government, club, commons, etc) can use to define good behaviors, track user behavior, identify people who enact good behaviors to possibly reward them, verify the effects of enacting such behavior for the community. The system aims to be generic enough that you can use it to track different problems: resource consumption, social behavior, political action, education policies, etc.

For the purposes of this hackaton, we are building a system that tracks gas consumption in a population and identifies households that consume less gas than average for their household type with the goal of rewarding such households within the community (with things such as tax credits, or free public transportation, etc).



## Components
- Smart meters that upload the hashed and timestamped gas consumption readings for a household
- Oracle, implemented as a SingularityNET service, to retrieve the gas consumption readings for each household, behavior data for identities in the community and public information about the community itself (example: carbon footprint of the community)
- Database of households (identity -> household type), hashed and timestamped at regular intervals
- A smart contract on a public blockchain with the latest timestamped hash of the households data
- AI service that confronts the readings with its own trained model to determine whether a household is enacting good behavior; the output (household, reward, input data, confidence) should be hashed and timestamped for auditing purposes
- Pluggable reward system that defines the ruleset and distributes incentives for each identity
